# AirBNB-properties
In this project, we sought to understand the relationship between the location of AirBNB properties and their prices, with the hypothesis that location is a key factor influencing price. We hypothesized that properties in more attractive or central areas would command higher prices, as such locations are often perceived as more attractive by tourists and travelers. To test this hypothesis, we used a dataset of AirBNB listings from 10 major cities around the world. By examining these cities, we aimed to answer the broader question: How and when does a property’s location affect its price? “Location” can be interpreted in different ways, so we chose to focus on two key dimensions for this analysis. First, we looked at the property’s distance from the city center, assuming that proximity to a central business district or popular tourist areas would make a property more attractive and therefore more expensive. However, we also considered the potential downsides of central locations, such as noise or congestion, which might mitigate this effect. Second, we examined the socioeconomic status of the neighborhood, hypothesizing that properties in wealthier and more upscale neighborhoods would likely command higher prices. This study is particularly interesting because understanding how location affects price can provide valuable insights for both property owners looking to improve their listings and tourists looking for accommodations that balance price and proximity.
